# nama_corpus
Here are the most important files within my thesis project.
In the course of this project I made an attempt to create a corpus of Khoekhoe language.
Thus, here you can find input data in the form of 10 .eaf files; 
config files to execute tsakorpus eaf2json convertor and indexator;
10 json.gz files retrieved as a result of eaf2json indexator
